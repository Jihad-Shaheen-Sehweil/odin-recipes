        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Falafel is a popular Middle Eastern “fast food” made of a mixture of
            chickpeas (or fava beans), fresh herbs, and spices that are formed
            into a small patties or balls. It's thought that falafel originated
            in Egypt as Coptic Christians looked for a hearty replacement for
            meat during long seasons of fasting or lent. It has also become a
            popular vegan food in Egypt and throughout the Middle East.
